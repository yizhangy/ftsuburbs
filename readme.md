#Project Introduction

###Business Problems
Imagine you are looking for a suburb to live in Auckland. You want to find out the information about the suburb. It is hard to find out useful information from Google search.
We want to build a web application to display a profile for each suburb.  We use 2013 New Zealand census data provided by New Zealand statistic department. We developed modern data visualization and aggregated the raw data to present Auckland suburbs characteristics and its own attributes. You can explore the suburb geography information, population, economics, dwelling, family, ethnicity groups and so on.
